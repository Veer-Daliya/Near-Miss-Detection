# Cursor Rules for Near-Miss-Detection Project

## File Creation Policy
**CRITICAL: Do NOT create new files without explicit user approval.**
- Always ask the user before creating any new files, directories, or documentation
- Do not create test files, example files, or documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Do not create temporary files, backup files, or helper scripts without permission
- Only modify existing files unless the user specifically asks for new files

## Code Style and Standards
- Follow Python 3.11 conventions
- Use Black formatter with line length of 88 characters
- Follow Ruff linting rules as configured in pyproject.toml
- Use type hints where appropriate (mypy is configured)
- Write clear, readable code with meaningful variable names

## Project Structure
- Respect the existing project structure
- Do not reorganize files or directories without user approval
- Follow Python package conventions

## Git Workflow
- Work on the current branch (veer/agent-file)
- Do not commit changes unless explicitly asked
- Do not force push or modify git history without permission

## General Guidelines
- Be concise and focused in code changes
- Explain what you're doing when making significant changes
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Test changes when possible before suggesting them

## Error Handling
- Fix linter errors when making code changes
- Address type checking issues when modifying code
- Ensure code follows project conventions
